## Project Details

This project uses:
- **Cypress** for end-to-end testing.
- **BDD (Cucumber)** to structure test cases in feature files.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** to maintain clean and maintainable code by abstracting page interactions.

### Project Structure
cypress/: This is the root directory for all Cypress-related files and folders.

#### cypress/e2e/: Contains test files organized by feature (e.g., `login` and `signUp`).
  - **login**:
    - `loginSteps.js`: Step definitions for the login BDD scenarios in `login.feature`.
  - **signUp**:
    - `signUpSteps.js`: Step definitions for the sign-up BDD scenarios in `signUp.feature`.
  - **login.feature**: Contains BDD scenarios for testing the login flow.
  - **signUp.feature**: Contains BDD scenarios for testing the sign-up flow.

#### cypress/fixtures/: Contains JSON files with test data.
  - `credentials.json`: Stores user credentials and other reusable test data.

#### cypress/support/: Includes support files and helper functions.
- **page_objects**: Houses page object files, each encapsulating functions for interacting with a specific page.
    - `LoginPage.js`: Contains methods to interact with elements on the login page.
    - `SignUpPage.js`: Contains methods to interact with elements on the sign-up page.
- `commands.js`: Defines custom Cypress commands that can be reused across tests.

#### node_modules/: Contains all the projectâ€™s npm dependencies.

#### .gitignore: Lists files and folders to be ignored by Git, preventing them from being tracked in version control.

#### cypress.config.js: Cypress configuration file where you can set up various options for Cypress testing.

#### package-lock.json: Ensures consistent versions of dependencies are installed.

#### package.json: Lists project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

#### README.md: Provides documentation and an overview of the project.
